# task_delete - Delete Tasks

**Task ID:** 86c6e0q0f
**Status:** ✅ Implemented
**Command:** `cum task_delete` / `clickup task_delete`

## Synopsis

```bash
cum task_delete <task_id> [OPTIONS]
```

Delete a task with optional confirmation prompt.

## Arguments

| Argument | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `task_id` | string | ✓ | Task ID or "current" from context |

## Options

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `--force`, `-f` | flag | Skip confirmation prompt |

## Examples

### With Confirmation
```bash
$ cum task_delete 86c6e0xyz
Delete task 'API Development' [86c6e0xyz]? (y/N): y
✓ Task deleted: API Development
```

### Force Delete (No Prompt)
```bash
cum task_delete 86c6e0xyz --force
```

### Using Context
```bash
cum set_current task 86c6e0xyz
cum task_delete current -f
```

## Output

### Success
```
✓ Task deleted: API Development
```

### Cancelled
```
Delete task 'API Development' [86c6e0xyz]? (y/N): n
Cancelled.
```

### Error
```
Error fetching task: ClickUp API Error 404: Task not found
```

## Behavior

### Confirmation Prompt
- Shows task name and ID
- Accepts 'y' or 'yes' (case-insensitive)
- Any other input cancels deletion
- Bypassed with `--force` flag

### Deletion Effects
- Task is permanently deleted
- Subtasks are NOT automatically deleted
- Comments and attachments are deleted
- Cannot be undone

## API Endpoint

`DELETE /task/{task_id}`

## Notes

- Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone
- Subtasks remain orphaned (parent becomes null)
- Consider archiving instead of deleting for audit trails
- Use `--force` in scripts to avoid interactive prompts
- Task must exist (fetched before deletion for confirmation)

- [`task_create`](#86c6e0q0b) - Create new tasks
- [`task_update`](#86c6e0q0d) - Update tasks
- `task_archive` - Archive instead of delete (not yet implemented)

## Warnings

⚠️ **Permanent Action** - Deleted tasks cannot be recovered
⚠️ **No Cascade** - Subtasks are NOT deleted automatically
⚠️ **Audit Trail** - Consider using status changes instead for tracking

## Use Cases

### ✅ Good For

- Cleaning up test data
- Deleting spam/invalid tasks
- Removing abandoned work

### ⚠️ Consider Alternatives
- Completed work → Set status to "Closed"
- Cancelled work → Set status to "Cancelled"
